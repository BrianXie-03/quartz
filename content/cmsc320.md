# Introduction to Data Science

Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on discovering patterns and describing relations using data, consisting of computational and statistical techniques to address or gain [managerial or scientific] insight.

Take raw data and turn it into insights about the world or predictions about the future.

## Big Data and Data Science

Big data describes datasets with large volume, created and updated with high velocity that have variety in structure and format.

Volume: The amont of data from myriad sources.

Velocity: The speed at which big data is generated

Variety: The types of data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)

Raw Data Ex.
- Medical records
- Patient demographics
- Lab results

Insights and Predictions: Identifies patterns in patient data to
- predict disease outbreak
- optimize treatment plans
- provide insights for medical research

## The Data LifeCycle

Data Collection -> Data Processing -> exploratory analysis & data visualization-> Analysis, hypothesis testing & Machine Learning -> Insight & Policy Decision

Note: Data science is not a strictly one-way linear process; it's dynamic, iterative, and adaptive (revisit previous steps along the way

### Before all: Define Problem Statement

What problem are you going to solve?
* Well-defined problem statement to collect and determine what information needed

### Collect Data

Data collection is a systematic approach to gather relevant information from a variety of sources.
- Gather from external sources
- Gather from existing company databases
- Gather by tools created by you

#### Methods

2 Types of Data Collection Methods

- Primary Data Collection
  - Web Analyics
  - Surveys
  - Listening Labs

Situation: Some unique problem and no related research is done on the subject
Solution: collect new data -> Primary data collection

Different Methods: Surveys, interviews of employees and by monitoring the timespent by employees in cafeteria.

Note: Time Consuming

- Secondary Data
  - Publishing Articles
  - Blogs
  - White Papers

Situation: Some problem and the data is readily available for collected by someone else.
Solution: Use the data -> Secondary data collection

Different Methods: The internet, news articles, government census, magazines nad so on.

Note: Less tiem consuming than the primary methods


### Data Processing

Clearn or scrub data to ensure the data quality.

Sanity checks on data (i.e, in a collection of data on test scores for N/A responses replace N/A entries with a neutral value like 0 and filling in missing score with the correct value).

### Exploratory Analysis & Data Visualization

Extract useful insights from the data, understanding patterns, and setting the stage for effective model building and decision-making
Important to analyze the data and build familiarity with the data
Skipping this step may lead to inaccurate models as well as insignificant variables in your models.

Exploratory Analysis: Find correlation between study hours and scores by calculating the average score, find the range of scores, and notice that some students scored exceptionally well.

Data Visualization: Visually show the relationship between study hours and average scores for different groups of students in order to revevla that students who study more tend to have higher average scores.

### Analysis, hypothess testing & Machine Learning

Build a model (making a machine learnig model that predicts a student's test score based on their study hours, train the model).

### Insight & Policy Decision

- Deriving Insights and make policy decisions if needed.
- Present the results from your analysis to the stakeholders.
- Convince people: explain the specific conclusions and critical findings, probably in understandable manner.

## Career in Data Science

- Data engineers: gathering and storage. Extract, transform, and load datasets for later analysis.

- Data scientists: gather data, transform data, and use models and alogirthms to extract meaningful insights from datasets
