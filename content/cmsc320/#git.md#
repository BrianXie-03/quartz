# Introduction

Version Control System (VCS)

**Definition:** A software tool used by developers to manage change to source code over time.
* Tracks modifications to files, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project simultaneously while maintaining a complete history of all changes made to the codebase.
* If there are issues, a version control system allows you to revert to an earlier code version.


Centralized: There is a single "central" coopy of your project soemwhere (probably on the server), and programmers will 'commit' their changes to this central copy directly

Distributed: Each programmer has a full project copy on their local machine. They commit changes locally and use push and pull operations to sync with a shared server for collaborations.

The git repository, represented by the '.git' directory is a database that contains all the project source code and the history of all code updates. The '.git' directory is typically located at the root of the project directory.
